# PowerSet README

The two markdown documents are both guides to PowerSet. The third is a document of strategies and other information for PowerSet Singleplayer.

READ THE MULTIPLAYER POWERSET GUIDE FIRST. Even if you are going to play the Singleplayer version, reading the first guide will clear things up on how the pieces move, what different game mechanics are, and more. [Read this guide if you are using a computer to play.](../PowerSet-Guide/PowerSet-Computer-guide.md)

[Powerset Singleplayer Guide](../PowerSet-Guide/PowerSet-Singleplayer-guide.md)

[PowerSet Singleplayer Strats and Tips](../PowerSet-Guide/PowerSet-Singleplayer-Strats-and-Tips.md)

If you find any misspellings, grammar issues, or are confused on any part, I will make sure to add it to the guides to make them as informative as possible. I will *really* appreciate any help.

If you *really* like PowerSet and ***really*** want to help out, here is my discord name so you can contact me: `PercyCho#0396` . This does nOT MEAN you can spam me with friend requests. I go on discord alot, but I do not have the time to see if you all are trolling me or actually want to help!

*gets spammed in the distance*
