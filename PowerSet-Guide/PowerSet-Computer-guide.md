# PowerSet Computer Guide

Because most of the people reading this will be paying PowerSet on a computer, I should tell you how to play it on there. It's quite easy, but some people might not see it straight-forward.

## Username

In this game, you can change your username to anything you want, as long as it's under 20 characters and doesn't have any curse words. Once you've made it, hit "Submit". That should make a watermark appear in the top-left corner that says the username you made. This watermark is so when you screenshot your score, someone else doesn't steal it and say it's theirs.

(Psssst! Here's a cool little trick you can do with the username! If you put carets (^) around your username ^like this^ a secret feature will appear!)

## Game Settings

At the bottom left corner of the game window, there should be a little gear icon. Click it, and you'll find the info block disapears, and shows the settings instead. In order to go back to the info block which shows the scores, times, and pieces taken, click the same gear at the bottom of the page.

### Piece Color

This dropdown menu has you choose what color you want to be, either white or black. This is where you select it.

### Piece Speed

The default speed for all the pieces might be a little quick for you. In this dropdown, you choose how fast you want your piece to move.

The **Instant** speed instantly moves the piece, and is used by people who want to get the lowest time on a game.

The **Quick** speed moves the piece quick, but visibly, so it isn't an annoyance to watch it move every pixel. It is the default speed.

The **Medium** speed moves the pieces slower and more visibly, but not too slow. Make sure not to click too fast though. You might freeze the game.

The **Long** speed moves the pieces the longest. A staggering 0.75 seconds. Same as the Medium speed, make sure not too click too fast on the pieces.

### Submitting Settings

Once you change all the settings you want to change, click the "Submit Settings" button under the settings to submit all of them. **The settings will not save if you do not click the button.**

## Moving Your Pieces

Once you choose you difficulty and click "Start!" (which should be pretty self explanitory), a faded piece of the opposite color should appear on the opposite side of the board. That piece is not there yet, and will move there once you move there once you move your piece.

To move your piece, click on the piece you want to move. shaded red square should appear next to the piece. Those are the squares you can move that piece. You can either click on one of the red squares outside your piece to move there, or click on the red square over the piece you clicked in order to make the red squares disapear and be able to click on another piece. **You cannot decide to move another of your pieces if you have clicked a piece *unless* you click on the red square over your piece.** If you try to click on your helper or leader piece before a piece has been taken, nothing will happen.

The PowerSet User Interface (UI) cannot have you drag one of your pieces to a square on the board. It may be added in the future.

## Restarting a game

In order to restart a game, just refresh the page. The reason the page does not auto-refresh is because people may want to take a screenshot or picture of their score.
