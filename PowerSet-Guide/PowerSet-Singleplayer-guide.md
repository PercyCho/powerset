# PowerSet Singleplayer

What is PowerSet Singleplayer? And why is it so long and complicated to spell?

Well, PowerSet Singleplayer is a game for all you loney chumps who have no one to play with, and want to speedrun but also use tatical knowledge at the same time. (Or it's because I haven't learned laguages to make PowerSet multiplayer so people can play around the world.) This game is similar to PowerSet, but also similar to Space Invaders. You'll see why.

If you have NOT read the regular PowerSet guide, do so now. Alot of what I say here will not make sense if you don't: [PowerSet Guide](../PowerSet-Guide/PowerSet-guide.md)

## Objective

You try to protect the opposing pieces from getting to the back row and crossing the end of the board on your side for as long as possible.

## Setup

If you are playing on a computer, great! You should be able to choose the difficulty and color you want, and then start playing. Anything in here that talks about rolling a die or placing pieces you don't need to worry about! That's all calculated by the computer. Read it if you ever want to play on a physical board.

If you're playing on a physical chess board, no problem! Here's what you'll need:

* A chess board
* A die (or maybe two if you're *really* good at chess)
* Something to keep score
    * For instance, a tally on a notepad with a pencil
* And if you're really good at chess, bring a timer to see how fast you are

Get your chess board and pick what color you want to be, and then set your color up the way it's set up in regular PowerSet. If you're the white side, the right pawn goes one away from the leader, and if you're the black side, the left pawn goes one away from the leader. And whatever side you are, put your peice and the enemy piece that are on the Power Bar so you have 7 out of the 8 slots of power. Here's a pic of a regular PowerSet chess board:

And here's a pic of PowerSet Singleplayer set up for white:

And a set up for black:

After you pic what color you want to be, DO NOT set up the other side. This is singleplayer, we are playing against the game, not other people.

### Difficulty

After you pick your color, pick what difficulty you want.

Just a beginner? Choose **Relative**. This difficulty allows you to make more moves with less enemies. Your score might not be too high though.

Think you're pretty good and know what you're doing? Choose **Mappist**. This difficulty is the default, and has you take turns with the game so you both have equal competition. Your score in this difficulty is the average.

Are you a Grandmaster at chess??? (Or at least somewhat). Choose **Creator** This difficulty is the hardest, because it gets harder as you go along. This difficulty allows for maximum points.

Think you've pick the right difficulty? Great! Let's start playing the game.

## Starting the Game

In any difficulty of the game, the player moves first.

But before they move first, they roll the die.

The die is like the second player in this game. When you roll the die, a number from one to six should show up. If we look at the other end of the board, we see there are seven spaces across. We will align the numbers 1 through 6 to the spaces on the other side of the board. But you may be wondering how we align 6 numbers if there are 7 spaces across. At the beginning of the game, we skip the middle collum. So if you are aligning numbers, it should look like this (If you are the white side):

| B | 1 | 2 | 3 | X | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| W | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
| . | . | H | . | L | H | . | . |

Then we roll the die. what ever number the die lands on, locate that spot on the other side of the board and put a pawn of the opposite color behind it. This is the game's "first move". The pawn has not entered the game yet, but you know where it's going to go, that way you can make a move to stop it before it comes into play.

Now it's your move. You know where it's going to go, so you make your move with one of your pawns. Remember, this is like regular PowerSet, so you can't move your helpers yet.

After your move, you put the other side's pawn on the board where it's supposed to go. And now it's your move again. After you move, you do the following based on what difficulty you are:

### Mappist and Creator

After you move one of your pawns for the second time, you move the oposing pawn forward toward your side and roll the die again. Now, instead of the middle collum being being skipped over, we skip over the collum the previous pawn was in. So if the opposing pawn was on the thrid collum, we'd skip over it like this:

| B | 1 | 2 | X | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| W | . | . | B | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
| . | . | H | . | L | H | . | . |

So after we roll the die, we see what number we get and now put a pawn there. Let's just say we rolled a 4. We would count from the first collum, skipping over the third one the opposing pawn had came from and put a peice on the forth collum like so:

| B | 1 | 2 | X | 3 | B | 5 | 6 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| W | . | . | B | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |
| . | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
| . | . | H | . | L | H | . | . |

And it keeps going back and forth. After you roll the die, put the opposing peice in the approriate collum, and shift all the other opposing pieces forward, you make your move with one of your pawns.

### Relative

The Relative difficulty is similar to the Mappist difficulty, except that you roll the dice and place a new piece on the other side of the board every *other* turn the opposing side has. You still move all the opposing pieces forward to your side every turn, but you place a new piece every other turn.

## Midgame

Same as regular PowerSet, once the first piece is taken, whether it is your pawn or the opposing pawn, you can now use your helpers to attck the opposing pawns.

But in Singleplayer, the leader is not as powerful. Meaning he does not have his own move like in regular PowerSet. He moves with the rest of the pieces and can be taken by any of the opposing pieces. He also can only move ONE space at a time. This ensures that the game ends and not carry on because the king is getting all the opposing pawns in the back row. If he is being threatened by an opposing piece, he is top priority, and has to move out of the way. You lose if your leader is taken.

Once you take the first opposing pawn, MARK IT. Count however many opposing pawns you take before they reach your side.

Some things to note for midgame:

* Opposing pawns in Relative and Mappist will always move in a straight line and attack any pieces in front of them. But they can be taken out diagonally and from the front like regular pawns.
* If and when your pawns ever reach the other side of the board where the opposing pawns are coming from, moving forward will loop back around to your side in the same collum. If there's one of your pieces in the same collum as that pawn in the first row on the other side of the board, you have to wait for it to move so you can move there or go diagonally so you end up next to it.
* If an opposing piece lands in the first row on your side, it is TOP PRIORITY. If the leader or any other piece can take it, they MUST take it. If not, you just lost the game :/
* Make sure to move the Power Bar to however far the enemy is in your territory. It's not manditory, but helpful.

For Relative and Mappist, you continue placing the opposing pieces and moving your pieces until the opposing pieces take the leader or move past the end of the board. But for the Creator difficulty, more rules are put into place...

## Creator Rules

For someone to chose the Creator difficulty is the ultimate challenge. They are deadset on a high score and nothing will stop them. Here are the additional rules for the Creator difficulty:

### After 5 opposing pawns are taken

The game plays out in the beginning like the Relative and Mappist, but when the player takes 5 opposing pawns, some new rules come into play.

The opposing pawns now do not always move in a straight line. If there is one of your pieces diagonally in front of it, **it will attack it when it's turn arrives**. As soon as you take the tenth opposing pawn, this new rule applies to all opposing pawns.

But what if there are multiple pieces in front of the pawn? If there are two pieces in front of the opposing pawn, roll the die. If it comes up 1 through 3, the left most pawn gets taken. If it comes up 4 through 6, the right most pawn gets taken. If there are 3 pieces in front of the pawn, the dice roll 1-2 takes the left one, 3-4 takes the middle, and 5-6 takes the right one.

If there is an opposing piece blocking the opposing pawn, roll the die. If the die comes up 1-3, it will go the left, and if it comes up 4-6, it will go the right. If there is only one space in front of the opposing pawn it can move, it will move there. And if in the rare chance there are NO spaces in front of the opposing pawn and is blocked by opposing pieces, the blocked opposing pawn will simply not move. 

### After 10 opposing pawns are taken

If you've survived so long to take 10 pawns in Creator mode, then another rule comes into play.

Get another die (preferably a different color than the first one) and roll that die with your other one you use to place the pawns for the rest of the game. Keep rolling both die in the beginning of the opposing side's turn until the second die that was added rolls on a 6. If it rolls on a six, place a helper down on the opposite side of the board instead of a pawn. There can be no more than 2 opposing helpers on the board at a time. If your second die rolls a six but you already have two helpers on the board, place a pawn instead.

The helper will zig-zag down the board, moving two spaces diagonally every turn. If the helper is too close to one side of the board, it will zig-zag the other way. If it is in the three center collums and does not hit any walls while zig-zaging, roll a die. If it lands on odds, it will zig-zag to the left. If it rolls evens, the helper will zig-zag to the right.

If there is a piece blocking where it is supposed to go, it will only go one space in that direction. If an opposing piece occupies that square as well, it will go two spaces in the other direction and if there's a piece *there*, it will only move one space in that direction. If in the rare chance there are no places in front of the opposing helper that it can move, it will just not move.

Remember to mark if you take an opposing helper on your score sheet. This will boost your point, explained in the Scoring section.

### After 15 opposing peices are taken

This might seem impossible to normal people, but skilled speedrunners and Grandmasters surprise people.

If you take 15 opposing pieces, the helpers become hostile, like the pawns now are. The same rules that apply to the pawns will now apply to the helpers, which is, if one of your pieces is in one of the spaces where the helper can move, you roll the die and do the same thing you do with the pawns. If there are 4 pieces the helper can get, roll your die. If it is odds, now roll for the left side, and if it evens, roll for the right. Then roll a second time for that chosen side, like you do if there are two pieces the opposing piece can get.

### After 20 opposing peices are taken

If you reach this check point, you are automatically a Grandmaster at the game of PowerSet Singleplayer. No questions asked. I doubt anyone will reach this checkpoint though.

Once you get to this point, there are new rules to the points, but those will be explained in the Scoring section.

## Scoring

Once you lose the game, no matter what difficulty, check how many opposing pieces you took. Here's what you multiply to get your score for each difficulty:

* For Relative: *pawns taken* x 0 = Your Score
* For Mappist: *pawns taken* x 100 = Your Score
* For Creator: (*pawns taken* x 150) + (*helpers taken* x 500) + (*pawns taken after 19* x 600) + (*helpers taken after 19* x 2000) = Your Score

Now, throughout any game you play, that number will be high score, becuse the number it is multiplied by balances out it's difficulty. Because Relative is the easiest mode, it doesn't get any points. People can and will play it forever and ever, stacking up points and not losing a single piece. Relative is meant for **practice**, not a actual game
