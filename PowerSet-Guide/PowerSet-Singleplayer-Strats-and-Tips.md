# PowerSet Singleplayer Strats and Tips

This markdown document is going to explain more information about PowerSet Singleplayer and some strategies I've found about to help get farther.

## Opposing Piece Positions

When playing a few rounds of PSSP (PoweSet Singleplayer), I realized some of the opposing pieces formed shapes on the board. Here are some of them from most common to most rare.

When three opposing pieces form a small arrow pointing left or right, that is called a **switch**. It is probably the most common and messes up people's gameplay the most:

When three or more opposing pieces form a diagonal line on the board which goes to the left or the right, it's called exactally what it is, a **line**.

When 4 or more pieces continue that switch and zig-zag up the board, that becomes a **zipper**. They're probably one of the worst formations to get.

When five or more opposing pieces form a bigger arrow pointing left or right, that is called an **arrow**.

Now to some of the Rarer formations.

When a line continues, hits a wall, and *bounces off it* for even one square, that is a **bounce**.

And the last and probably rarest formation, the **funnel**. This is when you roll, from the beginning of the game, a 6,1,5,2,3,4,4, or a 1,6,5,2,4,3,3 on a physical board with a die. It makes an upward arrow toward the other side of board, and is definitely a rare formation you should be proud you got.
