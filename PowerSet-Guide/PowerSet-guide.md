# PowerSet Guide

In this Markdown document, we will be learning how to play PowerSet.

In short, it is a game where two people duel to control the Power Bar and the board in order to take the opponent's leader. It might seem like a complex variant of chess, mostly because it kinda is. But there are a few key things which make it it's own game.

## Setup

![Setup picture](setup.png)

If you are playing the online Creator (default) version of PowerSet, great! The board should look like this. If you are playing PowerSet using a physical chess board, set up the board like this. There should be seven pawns the second row forward and two helpers in the first row on either side of the leader, but the helper closest to the power bar moved one space away from the leader. The leader should be boxed in. if you are playing on a physocal board, the pawns from a chess set can obviously be used as these pawns, but the helpers can be the two knights, bishops, or rooks. The choice doesn't affect gameplay. The leader in the center in the back of each side can be a king, queen, or any other special piece that is unlike any other peice on the board. Whatever you chose will have no special bonuses and will still be the leader, which is what I will be calling that piece for the rest of the document. The two pieces of different color at the far side of the board should be centered facing each other, with their respective color being behind them. If you are playing on a physical board, you can make the peice a knight, bishop, or rook. The collum they take up will be called the Power Bar.

### Custom Sides

If you think the default setup is too boring, you can customize your 7 pawns, 2 helpers, and 1 leader in the 2 by 7 at the end of each side. No piece except the two centered and opposite colored pieces should be in the Power Bar collum, and no piece should  should go beyond the first two rows on the board. Additionally, the two helpers MUST be on differently colored squares. Here is a picture of a correct custom set board:

### Who moves first

In the beginning of the game, each player can chose what color they want to be. This does not decide who goes first. The player who moves first is not decided by what color they get or how old they are. It is decided by a guess. If you are playing on a computer, great! The computer should ask you to pick a number from 1 to 10. Whoever is closest to the computer's number goes first. If you are playing on a board, not a problem. Ask a person who will not be playing to flip a coin. Then you and your opponent will pick heads or tails while the coint is mid-air, and who ever is right when the coin lands moves first. If there is no one else around except you and your opponent, call the side as it's being flipped. Make sure the person flipping the coin is not using any methods to make a coin flip on a desired side, because that would be cheating.

## Starting the Game

Whoever was chosen to move first moves one of their pawns.

The pawns in the front row ONE space forward or diagonally forward. As shown in the image below, the pawns can move their piece and attack the other player's pieces ONE space forward and diagonally forward. They cannot go through peices or stack on peices, and do not have any bonuses for their first move or being moved first.

Once the first player to go moves their peice, the other player moves theirs. You and your opponet keep alternating between turns, moving any of your moved or unmoved pawns. By moving all your pawns to the center, you and your opponent try to gain control of the center. This is important because not only does it further you along the board and help the pawns get to the other side, but it also increaes your chance to have more pieces than the other player, which is crucial for midgame, what we will be talking about next.

Once you are at a point where one of you has to make a move that allows the other player to take one of you peices, then the game really starts.

## Midgame

When one player has moved all the pieces to the center and they have to move a peice that will allow the other player's pawn to take them, midgame slowly starts.

If other player decides not to take their opponet's piece even though it was put in harms way, midgame does not start. It ONLY STARTS when one of the player's pawns gets taken.

In the move when one player takes abother player's piece, midgame starts. Right after the attacking player takes their opponet's peice, the attacking player can now move their leader. For both players, the option to move your leader after you make a move with the pawns or helpers is not available. A "move" now consists of a required move of one of any of your pieces, and then an optional move of the leader. This applies to BOTH players once the attacking player takes their opponent's piece.

The leader is not like any of the other pieces in the game. It does not interact with any other piece on the board, but is blocked by them. The only piece it can interact with is the other leader. The way the leader moves is like how a rook moves in chess. It cannot go diagonal, but it can go horrizontal or vertical in any direction and in as many spaces as it wants. Here is an image to show how it moves:

The only piece we could move before was the pawn, but now we can move the helper. Once that attackung player takes the other player's piece and decides of they want to move their leader or not, the other player goes. The other player can now, if they want to, move their helper.

The helper is like a cross between a bishop and a knight. It can move or attck by going ONE, TWO, or THREE spaces diagonally in any direction over any piece. Below is a picture of how they move.

Once midgame starts, these rules now apply. The helpers can now be moved to help attack the other side's pawns and leaders can now be moved after a pawn or a helper is moved.

And once midagame starts, the Power Bar on the side comes into play.

## The Power Bar

The Power Bar is exactally what it sounds like it is. It's a bar that shows both players power.

The Power Bar moves when one player has more pieces than another player. Here is a chart to illustate:

| How many pieces ahead | Power Bar | Effect |
|:-:|:-:|---|
| White king is taken | - | Black wins |
| B+>2 | W | Every Black piece can now attack the White leader |
| B+2 | W | Black leader can move diagonally, Black helpers can now attack White leader | 
| B+1 | W | Nothing happens |
| W=B | White | Nothing happens |
| W=B | Black | Nothing happens |
| W+1 | B | Nothing happens |
| W+2 | B | White leader can move diagonally, White helpers can now attack Black leader |
| W+>2 | B | Every White piece can now attack the Black leader |
| Black king is taken | - | White wins |

Because the chart is confusing, let me explain what it means. If, let's just say, the Black player has one more piece than the White player, the white piece on the bar gets moved once space toward the white side and the black piece moves one down towards the white side as well. If the black side has two more pieces than the white side, the white piece on the bar moves one more down toward it's side and the black piece moves down one more to be next to it. Once the bar is two spaces down in one player's favor, that player gets a power-up. Now, that player's leader can move diagonally and their helpers can attack the other player's leader. If one player has 3 or more pieces than the other, the other player's piece on the bar goes all the way down to the last row, and the winning player moves theirs down to be next to it. The power-up the winning player now gets is the ability for all the pawns to be able to attack the other side's leader.

When the winning side puts the other leader in checkmate, the winning side's piece on the bar can knock out the other side's piece.

## Endgame and Winning

When one player's power on the Power Bar fills up almost all of the bar, Endgame starts. What this means is that the losing side gets a small power-up. Right after the winning player takes up 7 of the 8 spots on the Power Bar, the losing player's leader can now move to any empty space they want to on the board, but only for that one turn. They cannot save the chance to move anywhere they want for a later turn.

Once that happens, the game continues until the winning player checkmates the losing player's leader.

## Additional Rules

Here are some additional rules that might be overlooked and are not played in everygame.

The first of these rules is if one player's pawns succesfully make it to the other side of the board, the pawn turns into a helper, and the Power Bar is set one space forward in favor of that player. It's pretty much like capturing another player's pawn when you make it to the other side.

The second rule in these additional rules is probably the sneakiest rule, and one of the reasons the Power Bar exists. You can legally set the Power Bar one - and ONLY one - space forward in your favor for no reason at all. If the other player notices, the only way they can legally set it back is by setting it back to what it was *before* that first player tells them they sneakily set it one space in their favor. If they fail to move it back before the first player annonces it, it is now set that way and cannot be set back by the second player to stop them. The player who sets it, however, CANNOT announce they set it until 30 seconds after it is set. That way, players aren't setting it and announcing it before the other player can set it back. This rule applies to any point in the game, even when the game starts after setup. The only time you cannot move it forward in your favor is you are winning and you take up 7 of the 8 spots on the bar. However, if you take you only 1 of the 8 spots, you *can* do this. This can only be done ONCE throughout the ENTIRE GAME. Once one player does it and the other player sets it back or not, NO ONE can do it anymore.
